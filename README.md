# Transjakarta Corridor Overcrowding Analysis  

### 1. Background Context  
Transjakarta, the first Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Southeast Asia, began operating in Jakarta in 2004 with the mission of providing fast, affordable, and accessible public transportation while reducing traffic congestion. Over the years, the number of passengers has grown significantly, making Transjakarta a vital component of urban mobility in Jakarta.

However, with increasing demand, the system faces persistent challenges related to **overcrowding** and **uneven fleet allocation** across corridors. During peak commuting hours, certain corridors become highly congested, leading to delays, discomfort, and safety concerns, while other corridors remain relatively underutilized.  

These operational inefficiencies not only reduce passenger satisfaction but may also discourage the use of public transport, particularly among vulnerable groups such as **women, children, and the elderly**.  

To address these issues, a **data-driven analysis** is needed to identify overcrowded corridors, examine passenger demographics, and develop strategies that improve service reliability, comfort, and equity in public transportation.

### 2. Stakeholder  
The main stakeholder of this analysis is the **Transjakarta Operations and Safety Division**, which is responsible for managing schedules, headways, bus frequency, and fleet allocation across corridors.  

---

### 3. Problem Statement  
The central question addressed in this analysis is:  

**How can Transjakarta identify which overcrowded corridors should be prioritized for additional buses, considering passenger demographics?**  

This problem can be broken down into three guiding questions:  
1. Which corridors are the most overcrowded based on **passenger density** (passengers per departure)?  
2. When multiple corridors are equally overcrowded, what **additional factors** (e.g., gender composition, age groups) can guide prioritization?  
3. How can insights from passenger demographics be translated into **policy recommendations** that improve service quality?  

---

### 4. Goals  
The purpose of this analysis is to provide **evidence-based recommendations** for improving Transjakarta’s operations. Specifically, the goals are to:  
- Identify the busiest and most overcrowded corridors.  
- Highlight demographic groups most affected by overcrowding.  
- Recommend corridor prioritization for additional bus allocation.  


✍️ This project was developed to support **evidence-based transport planning** and promote **equitable access to public transportation** in Jakarta.
